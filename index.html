            <div class="col-sm">Hello! My name is Morgaan Holmes. I grew up in Northern Califronia and am currently living in the Bronx Borough of New York City. For the last 18 years all my jobs have been low pay customer service related jobs. Upon realizing that I do not have the emotional fortitude to be working with the general public professionally, I decided to look into other career options. During my explorations, I tried my hand at programming and realized that it was a lot more fun than I thought. I also realized that I was much better at it than I thought I would be. So, after exploring some avenues, I came across Woz-U and was drawn to their program. 2 years ago, I enrolled in the program, however due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to finish. However, now those circumstances have changed and I am dedicated whole-heartedly to completing the Software Development course and beginning a lucrative career in Computer Programming!</div>
